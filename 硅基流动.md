input
default:Silicon flow embedding online: fast, affordable, and high-quality embedding services. come try it out!
required

Input text to embed must be provided as a string or an array of tokens. To process multiple inputs in a single request, pass an array of strings or an array of token arrays. The input length must not exceed the model's maximum token limit and should not be an empty string.
The maximum input tokens for each model are as follows:

BAAI/bge-large-zh-v1.5, BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5, netease-youdao/bce-embedding-base_v1: 512
BAAI/bge-m3, Pro/BAAI/bge-m3: 8192
Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B, Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-4B, Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B: 32768

The string that will be turned into an embedding. the item must not exceed the max models tokens limitation.
Example:

"Silicon flow embedding online: fast, affordable, and high-quality embedding services. come try it out!"
